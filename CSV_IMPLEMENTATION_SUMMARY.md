# CSV Bulk Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview
The CSV bulk operations feature provides a unified approach to section management via CSV upload/download. This follows Canvas SIS sections.csv format for proper integration and shows **complete course state** including ALL sections (tool-created + existing/default) with enhanced campus context for better grouping decisions.

## Implementation Philosophy
- **ONE comprehensive template**: Shows current state + all sections + campus context
- **Integrated UI**: Part of main tool, not separate interface
- **Canvas SIS compatibility**: Follows official Canvas sections.csv format
- **Campus-aware**: Detects and suggests campus-based groupings
- **Permission-based**: Clear separation between modifiable and read-only sections

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. CSV Processor Service (`services/csvProcessor.js`)
- **Enhanced Template Generation**: Shows ALL sections (tool + existing) with campus context
- **Campus Detection**: Extracts campus info from section names and student emails
- **Student Grouping**: Groups unassigned students by detected campus
- **Permission Rules**: Clear distinction between modifiable and read-only sections
- **Canvas SIS Format**: Full compatibility with Canvas sections.csv specification

**Key Features:**
- Shows existing sections (including default) for context
- Detects campus information from section names and emails
- Suggests campus-based section names for new sections
- Comprehensive validation with permission checking
- Read-only protection for existing/default sections

#### 2. API Routes (`routes/csv.js`)
- **GET /api/csv/template**: Single endpoint for unified template
- **POST /api/csv/validate**: Enhanced validation with permission rules
- **POST /api/csv/execute**: Executes bulk operations with safety checks
- **Session Management**: Tracks changes for potential rollback

#### 3. Canvas API Service (`services/canvasAPI.js`)
- **Fixed getSectionEnrollments**: Added missing function that was causing errors
- **Section Type Detection**: Identifies tool-created vs existing sections
- **Enhanced Section Queries**: Better enrollment and section data retrieval

#### 4. Integrated UI (within `public/index.html` + `public/app.js`)
- **Download Template Button**: Gets complete course state as CSV
- **Upload Interface**: Validate and execute CSV operations
- **Real-time Validation**: Shows errors/warnings with permission context
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during operations

### Enhanced CSV Template Structure (Canvas SIS Format + Extensions)

1. **âœ… Campus Context**: Shows ALL sections (including existing/default) with campus information for better grouping decisions
2. **âœ… API Bug Fix**: Fixed `getSectionEnrollments` function error in Canvas API service  
3. **âœ… Security Enhancement**: Anti-tampering protection prevents section type manipulation
4. **âœ… Bulk Deletion Power**: Editing Lecturers can now bulk delete tool-created sections with strong safeguards

This provides a much more useful tool that gives complete course visibility while maintaining safety through permission-based protections and following Canvas SIS standards.
